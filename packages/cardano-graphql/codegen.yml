    # Review: it actually seems to be serialized to number in response json
    # Suggested solution:
    # Fork (and possibly open a PR) this dependency:
    # https://github.com/prisma-labs/graphql-request/blob/master/src/index.ts#L440
    # Either patching, or adding an option to provide a custom JSON serializer,
    # Where we would parse it into bigint, or likely into 'number | bigint'
